  <excerpt>I'm leaving the best job I've ever had and maybe ever will have.</excerpt>
  <content>&lt;p&gt;On March 6th I will leave my dream job. I spent years working towards this job. I slaved through front-end web development, email development, and data development (actually, I liked this job), to finally become a WEB APPLICATIONS DEVELOPER! And now, after only two and a half years, I'm leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/Posts/files/44139926934_499024fa68_h-1000x562_637181632766883662.jpg" alt="Mountains in Glacier National Park" width="1000" height="562" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not these mountains, but these are pretty, too. Glacier National Park, September 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, I will attempt to thru-hike the Pacific Crest Trail. If you haven't heard of it (and haven't obsessed over it for years already), it is a &lt;a title="PCTA - Discover the Trail" href="https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2,650 mile trail&lt;/a&gt; that runs from the Mexican border to just over the Canadian border through California, Oregon, and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to leave my job, sell all my possessions, move out of my apartment, and land myself in southern California sometime in early May. Then I'll walk. And walk. And walk. I'm not sure what I'll do after the trail, but I think I'll have some time to figure that out while I'm walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace and happy trails.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
